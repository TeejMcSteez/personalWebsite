            This is my personal website I built to show my projects and allow people to look at all my social media easily with one link.
        I currently attend Gaston College, pursuing an associate in science to transfer to university for a bachelors degree in computer science.
        I work at Piedmont Turf Farm, there I have learned how to better understand complex systems and operate complicated machinery which has aided me in my understanding of computer systems and all its moving (at a small scale) parts.
        I have worked with Arduinos and microelectronic parts to create simple circuits to accomplish simple tasks. I purchased an Ender 3 Neo which in combination with Fusion360 I use to make robot parts or simple brackets I need.
        I also have minor electronic repair skills such as replacing blown capacitors in an Xbox One power supply unit and troubleshooting minor PC problems.
        As my knowledge expands (and this website improves) this list will grow and get better!
