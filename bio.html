            Welcome to my personal website, a centralized platform designed to showcase my projects and provide seamless access to my social media profiles.
            
            I am currently enrolled at Gaston College, where I am pursuing an Associate of Science degree with the intention of transferring to a university to obtain a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science. In parallel with my academic pursuits, I am employed at Piedmont Turf Farm. My role there has enriched my understanding of complex systems through hands-on experience with intricate machinery, enhancing my comprehension of computer systems and their complexities.
            
            My technical endeavors include working with Arduinos and microelectronic components to construct basic circuits that perform specific tasks. Additionally, I have acquired an Ender 3 Neo 3D printer, which, in conjunction with Autodesk Fusion360, allows me to fabricate robotic components and various brackets to meet my project requirements.
            
            I possess skills in minor electronic repairs, including the replacement of defective capacitors in Xbox One power supply units and diagnosing as well as resolving a range of PC issues. My experience in building desktop computers primarily utilizes Windows 10/11 operating systems, though I also manage a Ubuntu PC configured as a TrueNAS server through VirtualBox.
            
            As I continue to broaden my knowledge base and enhance this website, I anticipate expanding this portfolio to better reflect my growing expertise.
